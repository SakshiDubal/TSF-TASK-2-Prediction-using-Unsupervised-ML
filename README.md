This is my Task-2 as a Data Science and Business Analytics Intern at The Sparks Foundation. The task was supposed to predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it usually using Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm.Unsupervised learning refers to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to identify patterns in data sets containing data points that are neither classified nor labeled.In other words, unsupervised learning allows the system to identify patterns within data sets on its own.
